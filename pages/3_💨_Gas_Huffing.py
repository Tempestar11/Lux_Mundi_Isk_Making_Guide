st.markdown("""To gas huff, you need a mining frigate, we DO NOT recommend using any barges as that makes you an easy target. New players or alpha pilots are recommended to use a Venture, while Omega pilots can use a Prospect. You will also need a gas cloud scoop, which can be fitted to the ship.
            There are three types of scoops available: T1, T2 and Faction scoops (Synidcate Gas Cloud Scoop).""")
st.info("**Note:** We do not recommend fitting a T1 scoop if avoidable due to it being too slow at harvesting.")
st.markdown("""
            T2 scoops are the cheaper option out of the fast scoops, however they have a significant residue chance. Meanwhile faction scoops are the fastest with 0 residue but they are also the most expensive option.
            The choice of scoop depends on your budget and the amount of gas you plan to harvest. If you see yourself doing gas huffing sparingly and more, Faction scoops are your go to. Few good hauls of gas will pay for the scoop.
